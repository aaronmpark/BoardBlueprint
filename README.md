# React - Keyboard Shopping Site

OBJECTIVES:

MUST DO:
make it look better and stuff

SHOULD DO:
get it to host externally (non-local) (can do through github pages OR vercel!)
add day/night mode button
add animations
add stuff in About page (possibly videos to learn more about keyboard building?)
OPTIMIZE THE PAGE LOADING (idk if can) -> separate the pages by like maybe 25-50 items...
